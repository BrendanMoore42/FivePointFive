## FivePointFive

### Requirements
* Python 3.6+

### Scope
FivePointFive is a infinite scrolling role-playing adventure that uses blood sugar numbers as attack/defense rolls. Linked with a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) or by manual input, the player fights through a barrage of enemies and bosses to collect as many chocolate chips as possible before defeat. 

We use A1C numbers to calculate player power for every turn. Player rolls distribute around 5.5 being the optimal blood sugar (A natural 20 for D&D enthusiasts). Weaker rolls, less than 4 or greater than 8 lead to different effects and status buffs.
